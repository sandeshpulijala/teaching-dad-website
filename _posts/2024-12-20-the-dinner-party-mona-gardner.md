## What is this story about?

"The Dinner Party" is a very short but powerful story written by **Mona Gardner**. It was first published in 1942. The story takes place in India, during the time when British people ruled the country.

The story teaches us an important lesson: **women are just as brave and calm as men** in dangerous situations.

## The Story in Simple Words

A group of people are having dinner at the house of a colonial official in India. During the dinner, a young girl says that women have moved past the old days when they would scream and jump on chairs when they saw a mouse.

A colonel (an army officer) disagrees. He says that women still cannot control themselves in a crisis. He believes that men have more self-control than women.

### The Dangerous Moment

An American naturalist (a person who studies nature) is also at the dinner. He notices something strange. He sees the Indian servant put a bowl of milk on the veranda (an open area outside the room).

He knows that only one thing would make someone put milk outside like that — **a cobra** (a very dangerous snake)!

He realizes the cobra must be somewhere in the room, probably under the table.

### The Test of Control

The American man decides to test everyone's self-control. He tells all the guests:

> "I want to see who has the best control. I will count to 300. Nobody must move at all. The person who moves will lose."

He starts counting slowly. Nobody moves. When he reaches 280, the cobra comes out and goes towards the milk. The servant quickly closes the door to trap the snake outside.

### The Surprise Ending

Everyone is shocked! The colonel turns to the American and says, "You were right! A man showed great control just now."

But the American asks a simple question to the hostess (the lady of the house):

> "How did you know the cobra was under the table?"

She replies calmly:

> "It was crawling across my foot."

**This is the most important moment of the story.** The woman had a deadly snake touching her foot, but she did not scream or move. She stayed calm and quietly told the servant to put milk outside to attract the snake away.

**Remember:** This story teaches us not to judge people based on whether they are men or women. Courage and self-control are human qualities, not just male qualities.
