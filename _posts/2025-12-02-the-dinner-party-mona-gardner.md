## What is this story about?

"The Dinner Party" is a very short but powerful story written by **Mona Gardner**. It was first published in 1942, and the story takes place in India during the time when British people ruled the country.

At its heart, this story teaches us a simple but important lesson — **women are just as brave and calm as men** when they face danger. Let's look at how Mona Gardner tells this story.

## The Story in Simple Words

Imagine a grand dinner party at the home of a British official in colonial India. Important guests are seated around a beautifully decorated table, enjoying their meal and having conversations.

During the dinner, a young girl makes an interesting comment. She says that women have moved past the old days when they would scream and jump on chairs at the sight of a mouse. Times have changed, she believes.

But a colonel — an army officer who is also a guest — disagrees strongly. He argues that women still cannot control themselves during a crisis. According to him, men naturally have more self-control than women. This was a very common belief in those days.

### The Dangerous Moment

Now, here's where the story gets interesting.

An American naturalist (someone who studies nature and animals) is also sitting at the dinner table. While everyone else is busy talking, he notices something strange. He sees the Indian servant quietly place a bowl of milk on the veranda — the open area just outside the room.

Why would someone suddenly put milk outside during dinner?

The American knows the answer immediately. There's only one reason to do this — **a cobra is nearby**. Cobras are attracted to milk, and someone is trying to lure the snake away.

His heart races as he realizes the cobra must be somewhere in the room, probably hiding under the dining table where everyone's feet are!

### The Test of Control

The American thinks quickly. He wants to test everyone's self-control — especially after the colonel's comment about women being weak.

He announces to all the guests: *"I want to play a game. Let's see who has the best control. I will count to 300, and nobody must move at all. The person who moves will lose."*

Everyone agrees to play along, thinking it's just a fun game.

He starts counting slowly. One... two... three...

The room is completely still. Nobody moves a muscle.

When he reaches 280, the cobra finally slithers out from under the table and moves towards the bowl of milk on the veranda. The servant quickly shuts the door, trapping the snake outside.

Everyone is safe!

### The Surprise Ending

The guests are shocked. There was a deadly snake under their table this whole time!

The colonel, impressed by what just happened, turns to the American and says proudly, *"You were right! A man just showed incredible control!"*

He assumes the American man was the hero who stayed calm.

But the American has a question. He turns to the hostess — the lady of the house — and asks her quietly:

*"Mrs. Wynnes, how did you know the cobra was under the table?"*

She answers calmly:

*"Because it was crawling across my foot."*

**This is the most powerful moment of the entire story.**

Think about it. This woman had a deadly cobra — one of the most dangerous snakes in the world — actually touching her foot. It was crawling over her. And yet, she didn't scream. She didn't jump up. She didn't panic at all.

Instead, she stayed perfectly calm, quietly signaled to the servant to put milk outside, and waited patiently for the snake to leave. She showed more self-control than anyone else in that room — including all the men.

## What We Learn From This Story

Let's think about each character and what they represent:

**The Colonel** believed that women are weak and cannot handle dangerous situations. He was stuck in old-fashioned thinking and made assumptions without any proof.

**The Hostess** proved him completely wrong. With a cobra on her foot, she remained calmer than anyone. She didn't need to boast or argue — her actions spoke louder than words.

**The American** was smart and observant. He noticed the danger and created a clever way to keep everyone still until the snake left. He also made sure the hostess got the credit she deserved at the end.

### The Key Message

This story breaks a harmful **stereotype** — the wrong belief that women are naturally weaker or more emotional than men. 

The truth is, courage and self-control are **human qualities**. They have nothing to do with whether you are a man or a woman. The hostess proved this beautifully, without saying a single word about it.

## Think About It

Here are some questions to reflect on after reading this story:

1. Why do you think the colonel believed that men are braver than women? Where do such ideas come from?
2. The hostess never argued with the colonel or tried to prove herself. How did her silence make her victory even more powerful?
3. If you were in her place, with a snake crawling on your foot, what would you have done?

**Remember:** This story teaches us never to judge people based on their gender. Courage, calmness, and strength are qualities that anyone can have — man or woman. Actions always speak louder than words!
